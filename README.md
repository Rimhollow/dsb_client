DSB Client Library
==================

The DSB client library is a prototype component of the
Presence repository system being built at the 
University of Kentucky.  Adrift at sea, it is content
to be a component of a component of an interface between
two larger systems it hardly knows: a mysterious 
Front End and the darkly archival DAITSS.  For its part,
the DSB talks to the DAITSS SIP Builder to help pass
messages between the Front End and DAITSS.

A sample config file is included.
