DSB Client Library
==================

The DSB client library is a prototype component of the
Presence repository system being built at the 
University of Kentucky.  Adrift at sea, it is content
to be a component of a component of an interface between
two larger systems it hardly knows: a mysterious 
Front End and the darkly archival DAITSS.  For its part,
the DSB talks to the DAITSS SIP Builder to help pass
messages between the Front End and DAITSS.

The Front End and DAITSS SIP Builder are not yet public.
[DAITSS](http://daitss.fcla.edu/) itself is available
from the [Florida Center for Library Automation](http://fclaweb.fcla.edu/)
and on GitHub.  See [daitss](https://github.com/daitss/) for more details.

A sample config file is included.
